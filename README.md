# Duplicate Question Detection (DQD)

## Overview

Duplicate Question Detection (DQD) is a project aimed at identifying and flagging duplicate questions within a dataset. This is particularly useful in environments like Q&A forums, customer support systems, and knowledge bases where users often submit similar or identical questions.

## Features

- **Neural Style Transfer Techniques**: Utilizes neural style transfer to combine the content of one image with the style of another, enhancing the model's ability to detect duplicates.
- **Deep Learning Implementation**: Built using advanced deep learning libraries in Python for high accuracy and efficiency.
- **Artistic Output Enhancement**: Leverages artistic enhancement techniques to improve the visual and interpretive quality of the detected duplicates.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Deep Learning Libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
